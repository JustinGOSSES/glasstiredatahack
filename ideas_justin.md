# Data Ideas

## What we have:
- venue names
- venue websites sometimes
- venue locations
- event artist IDs

## What we don't have:
- artist names
- art types

## Cleaning tasks
- finding actual names
- combine into one sheet
- create metadata like:
	- whether it is always single artists
	- max number of artists
	- min number of artists
	- how often events are heald there
	- whether the event location is new or old
	- how regular are event totals
	- how many similar art event locations are nearby within X distance


## Generating other Art related information / data



## Bringing in non-art data
- Census
	- ?
- Science
	- Point:
		- job titles searched for on point basis.
		- industries of job title on point basis.
	- Area grid or hex:
		- most common job title in x area basis.
		- most common industry in x area basis.
		- most common not widely distributed job title term searched for.
		- sum number of science job adverstisement tied buildings in area x.

# Purposes/Goals/Audiences

## Audiences:
- People interested in finding out what artist venues are near them.
- People looking to move to area X and wanting to know within X distance of Z location, what venus and art shows are nearby.

- Science and Art: Are there relationships, trends, etc. 
	- How is art distributed in comparison to science jobs?
		- Do the highest number of "points" occur in the same place?
		- Do certain categorization of science jobs and art events coincide? Can we hypothsize why?
			- Do job types or industries get associated geographically with certain art venue characteristics?
				- Does oil industry jobs get associated with galleries?
